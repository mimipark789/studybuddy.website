    <h1 class="R">What is a REVOLUTION?</h1>
   
    <p class="contain">
        
        In the fields of history and political science, a revolution is a radical change in the established order, usually the established government and social institutions. or a revolution is a historical event or process that results in fundamental change in the way a society or political system is structured. Many different social and political changes can be called "revolutions," and there is no single correct way to categorize them. However, it is still important to have a general idea of what kinds of revolutions have occurred in history.
        Revolutions have occurred throughout human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology. Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions, usually in response to perceived overwhelming autocracy or plutocracy.Scholarly debates about what does and does not constitute a revolution center on several issues. Early studies of revolutions primarily analyzed events in European history from a psychological perspective, but more modern examinations include global events and incorporate perspectives from several social sciences, including sociology and political science. Several generations of scholarly thought on revolutions have generated many competing theories and contributed much to the current understanding of this complex phenomenon.Notable revolutions in recent centuries include the creation of the United States through the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the French Revolution (1789–1799), the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), the Spanish American wars of independence (1808–1826), the European Revolutions of 1848, the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Chinese Revolution of the 1940s, the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the Iranian Revolution in 1979, and the European Revolutions of 1989.
        There are some types of revolutions which include:
        1. Revolutionary Wars: In history, the word revolution most often refers to the forceful expulsion of the government, either to change to a different governing system or to establish independence from another country. 
        2. Government Overthrows: Sudden changes in government don't always happen through warfare. The French Revolution, one of the most important in Western history despite its ultimate failure, was characterized by violent riots and bloody crackdowns, but not large-scale war. And one of first popular uses of the word "revolution" for a change in government was in 1688, when England replaced Catholic King James II with Protestant William and Mary, an event known as the "Glorious Revolution" and remembered for its relative lack of violence. Other government overthrows are truly nonviolent, such as Czechoslovakia's 1989 "Velvet Revolution," which ended communism in the country through mass protests by the people.
        3.Economic Revolutions: Revolutionary changes can also affect the economic systems in a society. 
        4.Social and Cultural Revolutions: Political revolutions can bring about major social changes, as the French Revolution did, but other transformations of society are separate from changes in governing structures.
